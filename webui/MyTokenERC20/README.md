# ü™ô AlanDXiang Coin (ADX) - ERC20 Token Interface

This is a clean, modern web-based user interface for interacting with any standard ERC20 token smart contract. It is built with vanilla JavaScript and Ethers.js to provide a lightweight and easy-to-understand example of a decentralized application (DApp) frontend.

This interface allows users to connect their MetaMask wallet, view token information, and perform all standard ERC20 actions in a user-friendly way.
